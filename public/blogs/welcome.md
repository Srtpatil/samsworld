![Welcome to my internet home](/blogs/blog_assets/welcome.svg)

Well this is a milestone for me, I didn't think i would complete it but here we are, 
finally the blog feature is complete, so now we have another challenge of regularly or irregularly writing something.

I will try to write about how I created the blogging feature, mostly its just markdown to a good web page translation, we 
can talk about that for some other time. This `Launch Day` blog is just a test, hopefully everything is working.

## What to expect

* If I encounter a great problem, might write about it.
* Software concepts and stuff
* Tutorials and How-tos

Alright, Peace Out ✌️
